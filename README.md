Time goes on and things change, so are my view on software design.  
I will therefore rewrite the [Change Blog](https://github.com/stefan-jeitler/change-blog) app in a more functional way,  
guided by Scott Wlaschin's Book [*Domain modeling made functional*](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/).
